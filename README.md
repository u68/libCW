# libCWII v1.0
A library that contains stuff for the CWII calcs

To use:

Add `#include "libcwii.h"` to the top of your source files.

I do not reccomend mixing this with some of libc's stuff especially when using the heap, you are able to easily change the addresses of things to account for them.

Read `libcwii.md` for a more in depth explination on all of the features it provides.

### THIS ONLY WORKS ON CWII CALCULATORS, AND HAS TO BE BUILD USING THE LAPIS TOOLCHAIN
